  <h2 class="text-[#FC6B57] text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Step 1 – Start Planning Early</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">How to plan a children’s party: the golden rule is simple — start early.</p>

  <h3 class="text-[#FC6B57] text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">When Should You Start Planning?</h3>
  <p class="mb-4">For most parties, six to eight weeks in advance is ideal. If you’re thinking about one of the more popular kids party venues London offers or hoping to book a well-known entertainer, then even earlier is better.</p>

  <h3 class="text-[#FC6B57] text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Key Tasks to Tackle First</h3>
